# OpenWrt NSS

This started out as a private repo for building a variant of the work by [Qosmio](https://github.com/qosmio/openwrt-ipq) refining NSS usability on various Qualcomm platforms.

I personally only have an interest in a single target on the ipq807x platform, and have added a few custom packages as well. If you happen to be building for the Linksys MX4200 v1, then you don't need to change anything! 😅

Feel free to fork the repo (or just outright copy it, I don't care!) if the work in here is of use to you ❤️

(yes I know the commits are messy, I hate public repos because they show how incompetent I am! but they also give unlimited free minutes for GH Actions 🫣😅 don't judge me for the commit history on this repo please!)
